## Loading Usual Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Loading Data

The downloaded data is in .sav format. Use the `haven` package to open it. First install and load the package...

```{r}
install.packages("haven") # Put a hastag in front of this line after installing
library(haven)
```

Then use `read_sav()` rather than `read_csv()` to load the file.

```{r}
w74 <- read_sav("/Users/lawrence/Downloads/W74_Sep20 2/ATP W74.sav")
```
